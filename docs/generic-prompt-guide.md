# Generic Prompt Crafting Guide

This guide outlines universal techniques for designing effective prompts for large language models and AI assistants.

## Core Principles

- **State the goal**: Describe the desired outcome and target audience.
- **Provide context**: Supply background, assumptions, and any relevant data or prior steps.
- **Structure the task**: Use ordered steps or bullet points to reduce ambiguity.
- **Define output format**: Specify whether the response should be code, JSON, a table, or prose.
- **Show examples**: Offer input/output pairs to illustrate expectations.
- **Set constraints**: Note length limits, style preferences, or forbidden actions.
- **Invite reasoning**: Ask the model to explain its steps or verify results.

## Iterative Refinement

- **Review and adjust**: Examine the output and refine the prompt for clarity or additional constraints.
- **Break down complex tasks**: Split large objectives into smaller prompts and build on prior results.
- **Encourage questions**: Allow the assistant to request clarification when requirements are unclear.
