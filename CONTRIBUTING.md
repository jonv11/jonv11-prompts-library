# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to **jonv11-prompts-library**. To keep the library consistent:

- Use English unless a prompt specifies another language.
- Name files using `prompt-<keywords>.md`.
- Place prompts in the appropriate folder under `prompts/` (`coding/`, `data/`, `agents/`, `project-management/`, `chat/`, `other/`).
- Keep prompts clear, agent-agnostic, and reusable.
- Avoid duplication across categories.
- Update documentation when adding new prompts or folders.
- All contributions are released under the CC-BY 4.0 license.
- Refer to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for project roles and conventions.
