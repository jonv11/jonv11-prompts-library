- Keep comments concise, professional, and respectful.
- Address topics such as missing context, ambiguous requirements, feasibility concerns, risks, or alternative approaches.
- Avoid combining multiple issues in one comment.

Comment explaining the concern, suggestion, or improvement.
```

Continue until all notable issues are covered.
